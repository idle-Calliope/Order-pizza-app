# Problem
Ordering pizza can become nerve-wrecking whether it is on a call, or when you go to the store. 
There are so many options to choose from, and not enough time to decide, as well as the pressure of 
other customers in the line waiting for you to order. 

# Solution
Both the issues above can be solved by coming up with a digital solution - a live application to place your orders!
Create a live application for new and regular customers to sign into. They should be able to view the pizza menus,
extra menu, as well as the dessert and drinks menu. After deciding their order, users should be able to add
to their cart or place their orders, make payments, and be notified of the the cooking, and delivery duration.

# How to go about it
* Most pizza lovers are **"the usual customers"**, to keep track of this, users should be able to register
their necessary information and banking details. 
* Once they are registered, they should be able to login
* The customer must be presented with the specials
* The customer must be presented with the usual menu and extra menu(extra items)
* For the menu items, they must be able to customize the size, and the extra ingredients
* The customer should be able to add more to their orders and show a summary before confirming
* Before finalizing, the application should check if their payment plan works
* At finalization, the customer will be told how long it will take overall for delivery
* They should also be provided with a digital receipt
